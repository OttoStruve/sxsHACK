# sxsHACK
sxsHACK is an astronomy hack day at UT Austin.  It has nothing to do with sxsw.

We did [a hack day in January](http://gully.github.io/astronomy/2015/03/02/UTAustin-AstroHackDay/) and everyone liked it, so we're doing another one.  We're calling it sxsHACK.

It'll be on **Tuesday, March 17, 2014** 9:30 AM - 4:30PM.  
This is during UT Austin Spring Break.  It'll be in the astronomy classroom.

If you're interested in participating your can add your name to [the participant list](https://github.com/OttoStruve/sxsHACK/wiki/Participants).  
Even better, brainstorm and advertise your [hack ideas](https://github.com/OttoStruve/sxsHACK/wiki/Hack-ideas) before the day.

Oh yeah, and some of us are using [slack](astrodata.slack.com), which could be fun during the hack day.
